PC 4: Trajectory Generation
Objective:   To master trajectory generation using   cubic   splines   or   linear paths   with   parabolic   blends.Problem 1. How many individual cubics are computed when a six-jointed robot moves its end-   effector along a cubic   spline path through   two   separate   points   and   stops   at   a   goal   point?   How   many coefficients are stored to describe these   cubics?Problem 2. A single-link robot with arevolute   joint is motionless at   θ1 =   −5°. It is   desired to   move the joint   in   a   smooth manner to   θ1       =   80° in 4   seconds. Find the   coefficients   of a   cubic   that accomplishes this motion and brings the arm to rest at   the   goal.

Problem 4. Frame   {3} of   the two-link manipulator shown in   Figure   1   is   projected   to   move   to   the following locations:
Based   on   the   transformation   matrices   at   each   point,   if L1 =   L2 =   1,   find   the   cubic   functions   that   describe   each joint   angle   as   the   end-effector   moves   from rest   at   its   starting point   at time   t0, to   the   mid-point   at   t1, before   coming   to   rest   at   its   endpoint   at   t2   . Ensure   the   rate   of   change of   the   angles   of   joint   1 and   2 at   t1 are   continuous.Figure 1: A two-link RR   manipulator
